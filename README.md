# Learn Git

## Introduction
- Forget Initial Commit for now
- There are two branches - **master** and **working**
- The commit story is as follows:
	* First commit adds first.txt
	* Second Commit adds second.txt
	* Third Commit fixes typo in first file
## Tasks
- Clone the repository to your system
- Delete the third file, and commit the changes
- The second commit message is wrong. It should be changed to "Added Second File" 
- The third commit fixes a typo in the first file. To have a cleaner repo, merge these 2 commits into one.
- Merge working with master
- Push it to github at https://github.com/username/learn-git
